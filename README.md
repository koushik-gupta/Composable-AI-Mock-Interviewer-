An **AI-powered mock interview platform** that dynamically adapts questions, evaluates answers, tracks interview memory, and generates a **detailed final interview report**.

Unlike traditional interview tools that rely on static question lists, this system is built using **composable AI blocks** that work together to simulate a **real interviewer**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most interview preparation platforms suffer from:
- Static, predefined questions
- No adaptability based on answers
- No real evaluation or feedback
- No scoring or interview summary

This project solves that by building a **stateful, adaptive AI interviewer** that:
- Adjusts questions in real time
- Evaluates answers fairly (not overly strict)
- Tracks confidence vs competence
- Produces a professional interview report

## 🧠 Composable AI Architecture

The system is built using **independent AI blocks**:
```text
Role Block (Interview Type)
↓
Question Generator (LLM)
↓
Memory Block (Q&A History)
↓
Evaluation Block (Scoring)
↓
Feedback Block (Improvements)
↓
Final Report Generator
```

Each block is **loosely coupled**, making the system:
- Extensible
- Maintainable
- Easy to upgrade

---

## 🧩 Interview Modes

### 1️⃣ Normal Interview
- Select interview type: **Technical / HR / Behavioral**
- Select topic (Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc.)
- Optional resume upload
- Adaptive questioning based on performance

### 2️⃣ Project (GitHub) Interview
- Provide a **GitHub repository URL**
- AI reads the project **README**
- Questions focus on:
  - Design decisions
  - Architecture
  - Technical trade-offs
- Evaluates real-world understanding

---

## 🎤 Audio Mode (Voice Questions)

- Each interview question is **narrated using browser speech synthesis**
- Candidate can replay the question anytime
- Improves accessibility and realism

---

## 🧠 Adaptive Questioning Logic

Next question depends on:
- Quality of previous answers
- Interview phase (warm-up → intermediate → advanced)
- Candidate confidence vs observed competence
- Resume or project context (if provided)

This avoids:
- Repetition
- Random difficulty jumps
- Static interview flows

---

## 📊 Evaluation & Scoring

Each answer is evaluated on:
- Conceptual correctness
- Clarity of explanation
- Depth of understanding
- Practical reasoning

The evaluator is **intentionally mellowed**:
- Near-correct answers are not harshly penalized
- Encourages learning instead of discouragement

---

## 📄 Final Interview Report

After 5 interview questions, the system generates a **professional interview report**, including:

- Overall performance summary
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Confidence vs competence comparison
- Question-wise evaluation
- Final score & verdict
- Actionable improvement tips

📥 **Report can be downloaded as PDF**

## 🧠 Where AI Is Used

AI is used across the system:

- **Question Generation:** LLM dynamically creates interview questions
- **Adaptive Logic:** Next question depends on previous answers
- **Answer Evaluation:** AI scores responses and highlights gaps
- **Competence Estimation:** Tracks performance trends
- **Final Report Generation:** AI writes a structured interview report
- **Audio Narration:** AI-assisted text-to-speech (browser API)
- **Documentation:** This README was structured using **AI-assisted tooling (readme.so)**
